## explore advanced CLI
- What is the difference between the two commands > and >>?
        > tells the terminal to write the output of the previous command to a file and replace whatever is already in there. On the other hand, >> appends the output of the previous commnand to a file after the contents that is already in the file.

**************************** 
MacBook:cli_testing evan$ grep "how?" hello.txt >> my_file.txt
**************************** 

- Overwrite the content of my_file.txt with "tell me"

****************************        
MacBook:cli_testing evan$ echo "tell me" > my_file.txt
