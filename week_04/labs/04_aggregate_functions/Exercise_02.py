'''
User python's built-in .enumerate() function to print the classes
together with their numbers from 1-4.


NOTE: a less readable, but common structure in other languages would be:

for i in range(len(courses)):
    print(f"{i}: {courses[i]} python")

'''

courses = ['Intro', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'Epic Hero']

for index, item in enumerate(courses):
    print(index, item)
