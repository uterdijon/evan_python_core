1 - What is a value?
      A value is one of the basic things a program works with.
2 - What is a type?
      A value can be of one of several types, such as integer, float, string.
3 - What are some values we have seen so far?
      We have seen integers, floating-points, strings.
4 - What is an example of a int? A floating-point number? A string?
      Int: 6  Float: 8.3  String: "Bob"
5 - What is a variable?
      A variable is a name that points to a value.
6 - How do you assign the variable x to the value of 10?
      x = 10
7 - What is an example of an illegal variable name?
      Variables cannot begin with numbers: 84book
8 - What are keywords and what are they used for?
      Keywords are words that Python uses to recognise the structure of the program and they cannot be used as variable names. Example: while
9 - What are operands and what are they used for?
      Operands are the values/variables that undergo mathematical computations
10 - Use the interpretor to demonstrate the use of some of the operands. Give the input and output of addition, multiplication and exponentiation.
      >>> x = 3+5
      >>> print(x)
      8

      >>> x = 3 * 4
      >>> print(x)
      12

      >>> x = 4 ** 3
      >>> print(x)
      64


11 - What is floor division? How does Python 3 handle floor division?
      Python performs floor division when both operands are integers or if you use the // operator. In this case, it chops off the fraction in the result.

12 - What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
      An expression is composed of values, variables, and operators; it has a value. A statement is something that tells Python to execute a procedure, for example a function.

13 - What is the order of operations?
      P - parentheses
      E - exponents
      M D -multiplication/division
      A S - addition/subtraction

14 - What does the + operand do when performed on strings? What does the * operand do when performed on strings? What operands can you not use on strings?
      When performed on strings, the + operator concatenates them (joins them end-to-end) and the * repeats them the number of times indicated by the operand.

15 - How do you put comments in your code? What are comments used for?
      For comments, you must use # at the beginning or enclose them in ".
