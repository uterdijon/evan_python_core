1 - What is a string?
        A string is a sequence of characters in a fixed order.

2 - What is an index?
        An index is a way to refer to the location of an item in a string or list.

3 - What letter will the following code print? Why?

    word = 'hello'
    index_two = word[2]
    print index_two

        This will print "l"

4 - What is the len() functions used for?
        This function returns the length of a string.

5 - How can you get the last character of a word using the len() function?
        letter = word[(len(word))-1]

6 - What is string slicing and how does it work?
        String slicing allows you to select elements in the string based on their index: _string[1:2]

7 - How to do slice the string "python" to produce the string "thon"?
        word = "python"
        slice = word[2:6]

8 - How can you use slicing to store the first and last character of a word in separate variables?
        word = "python"
        first = word[0]
        last = word[5]

9 - What are the answers to Exercise 8.4 (p.80) from the textbook?


This function doesn't work because a function returns one value, the
def any_lowercase1(s):
    for c in s:
        if c.islower():
            return True
        else:
            return False


This function returns a string.
def any_lowercase2(s):
    for c in s:
        if 'c'.islower():
            return 'True'
        else:
            return 'False'


def any_lowercase3(s):
    for c in s:
        flag = c.islower()
    return flag



def any_lowercase4(s):
    flag = False
    for c in s:
        flag = flag or c.islower()
return flag

def any_lowercase5(s):
    for c in s:
        if not c.islower():
            return False
return True









10 - Can you change one or more character of a string? Why or why not?
        No, you cannot, because a string is immutable.

11 - What is invocation?
        Invocation is the word used for calling a method on an object.

12 - How do you invoke the find() method on the string word with the value 'hello' to find the index of the letter e?
        word = "hello"
        test = word.find("e")
        print(test)

def encoder():
    starting_string = str(input("Enter a message: "))
    degree = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    encoded = []
    for b in starting_string:
        c = ord(b)
        d = c + degree
        e = chr(d)
        encoded.append(e)
        str1 = ''.join(encoded)
    print("Your encoded message is: ",str1)

14 - Follow the directions for Exercise 8.1 (p.79) until you feel comfortable with the string methods and what methods are available.

15 - How is the in operator used?

    "in" is used between two strings and returns True if the first string appears as a substring in the second.
