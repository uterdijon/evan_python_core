1 - What is one important difference between tuples and lists?
        Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable

2 - What are two ways to create a tuple?
        _tuple = 'v',
        _tuple = tuple('v')

3 - Give an example of tuple assignment to assign two variables.
        name, age = 'Henry', 32

4 - Why is it beneficial to return a tuple from a function?
        A function can only return one value, but if the value is a tuple, it can serve the function of returning multiple values.

5 - What are variable-length arguments?
        The parameters begin with '*' and they take multiple arguments and gather them into a tuple. Conversely, writing * before the argument can scatter the argument into a tuple.

6 - How is gather and scatter used?
        These are used to make arguments conform to the required number of parameters.

7 - What does the zip function do?
        This takes multiple sequences and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains one element from each sequence.

8 - What does the items method do?
         It takes a dictionary returns a list of (key, value) tuple pairs.

9 - How are tuples compared when relational operators are used?
