- What is the difference between class attributes and instance attributes?
  Class attributes apply to the entire class, while instance attributes apply only to one object that is an instance of that class.

- What is inheritance?
    Objects and child classes can inherit their attributes from the parent class they are part of.

- Why do we use inheritance?
    To avoid repeating the same code again and again, and thus make our code more readable and efficient.

- How does a class inherit another class?
    When we create the class, we put the parent class in parentheses:

    class Dog(Animal):

- What is an example of a parent/child class relationship?
    Dog is a child class, Animal is a parent class.

- How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
    Indefinitely.
