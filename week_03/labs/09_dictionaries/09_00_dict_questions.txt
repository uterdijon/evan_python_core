1 - What is the difference between a list and a dictionary?
        A list has single items, a dictionary has items composed of key/value pairs.

2 - What is a key-value pair?
        Two pieces of data that are connected in a dictionary.

3 - How do you add an item to the dictionary first_dict using square
    brackets?
        first_dict[a] = 12

4 - How do you add several items to the dictionary first_dict using
    curly braces?
        first_dict = {a: 12, b: 8, c:4}

5 - When you print out a dictionary, is there a order to the items?
    Why or why not?
        No, python dictionaries are unordered.

6 - How do you print out a value using a key?
        print(first_dict[a])

7 - How does the in operator work with dictionaries?
        It searches the keys.

8 - What is an implementation?
        A particular way of performing a computation.

9 - Write an example for loop to traverse a dictionary loop_dict and
    print out the keys and values.
        for i in my_dict:
            print(i, my_doct[i])

10 - How can you find search for a key given a value.
    What is this called?

        def reverse_lookup(d, v):
            for k in d:
                if d[k] == v:
                    return k
            raise LookupError()


        This is called a reverse lookup

11 - Can lists be keys of a dictionary? Why or why not?
        No, because only immutable types can be keys. Keys cannot be changed.

12 - Can lists be values of a dictionary? Why or why not?
        Yes, because values can be changed.

13 - What is a global variable?
        A variable that exists outside a function. If you want to change it from within a function, you must type:
            global /variable/
            in the function.

14 - How do you reassign a global variable inside of a function?
        See above.

15 - When do you not need to use the "global" keyword to modify the
    value of a global variable?
        When you are modifying elements of a list or dictionary.
